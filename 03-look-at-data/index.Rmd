## Data-to-ink ratio

.pull-left-wide[
Tufte strongly recommends maximizing the **data-to-ink ratio** this in the Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte, 1983).

> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design … [It] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. … [It] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space … [It] is nearly always multivariate … And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data. (Tufte, 1983, p. 51).

## Review: RQ 1

.task[
**Question 8.** Which of the following is **FALSE** about the data-to-ink ratio?
]

a. Data-to-ink ratio can be increased by removing content-free decoration. (TRUE)

b. **Data-to-ink ratio can be increased by choosing a more accessible color palette.** **(FALSE)**

c. Visualizations with high data-to-ink ratio can be cognitively difficult for viewers to interpret. (TRUE)

d. Visualizations with excessive 'chart junk' tend to have low data-to-ink ratio. (TRUE)

## Global vs. layer-specific aesthetics

- Aesthetic mappings can be supplied in the initial `ggplot()` call, in individual layers, or in some combination of both.

- Within each layer, you can add, override, or remove mappings.

- If you only have one layer in the plot, the way you specify aesthetics doesn’t make any difference. However, the distinction is important when you start adding additional layers.
