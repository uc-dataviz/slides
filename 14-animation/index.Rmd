# Animation

---

## Philosophy

- The purpose of interactivity is to display more than can be achieved with persistent plot elements, and to invite the reader to engage with the plot.

- Animation allows more information to be displayed, but developer keeps control

- Beware that it is easy to forget what was just displayed, so keeping some elements persistent, maybe faint, can be useful for the reader

---

## **gganimate**

.pull-left[
- **gganimate** extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation

- It provides a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time

## Animation example

```{r freedom-race, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, gganimate = list(nframes = 30, fps = 2), out.width = "80%", cache = TRUE}
freedom <- read_csv(here::here("14-animation", "data/freedom.csv"), na = "-")

countries_to_plot <- freedom %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(sd = sd(c_across(contains("cl_")), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(sd)) %>%
  relocate(country, sd) %>%
  slice_head(n = 15) %>%
  pull(country)

freedom_to_plot <- freedom %>%
  filter(country %in% countries_to_plot) %>%
  drop_na()

freedom_ranked <- freedom_to_plot %>%
  select(country, contains("cl_")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "civil_liberty",
    names_prefix = "cl_",
    names_transform = list(year = as.numeric)
  ) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(rank_in_year = rank(civil_liberty, ties.method = "first")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(is_turkey = if_else(country == "Turkey", TRUE, FALSE))

freedom_faceted_plot <- freedom_ranked %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = civil_liberty, y = factor(rank_in_year))) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = is_turkey), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(-5, 7),
    breaks = 1:7
  ) +
  geom_text(

    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

freedom_bar_race <- freedom_faceted_plot +
  facet_null() +
  geom_text(
    x = 5, y = 1,
    hjust = "left",
    aes(label = as.character(year)),
    size = 10
  ) +
  aes(group = country) +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  labs(
    title = "Civil liberties rating, {frame_time}",
    subtitle = "1: Highest degree of freedom - 7: Lowest degree of freedom"
  )

freedom_bar_race
```

## How does gganimate work?

- Start with a ggplot2 specification

- Add layers with graphical primitives (geoms)

- Add formatting specification

- Add animation specification

# Grammar of animation

---

## Grammar of animation

- Transitions: `transition_*()` defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time

--
- Views: `view_*()` defines how the positional scales should change along the animation

--
- Shadows: `shadow_*()` defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time

--
- Entrances/Exits: `enter_*()`/`exit_*()` defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation

--
- Easing: `ease_aes()` defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions

---

## Transitions

How the data changes through the animation.

```{r transition-tbl, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
  ~ Function, ~ Description,
  "transition_manual", "Build an animation frame by frame (no tweening applied).",
  "transition_states", "Transition between frames of a plot (like moving between facets).",
  "transition_time", "Like transition_states, except animation pacing respects time.",
  "transition_components", "Independent animation of plot elements (by group).",
  "transition_reveal", "Gradually extends the data used to reveal more information.",
  "transition_layers", "Animate the addition of layers to the plot. Can also remove layers.",
  "transition_filter", "Transition between a collection of subsets from the data.",
  "transition_events", "Define entrance and exit times of each visual element (row of data)."
) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 26)
```

---

## Transitions

.task[
Which transition was used in the following animations?
]

.pull-left[
```{r transition-layers, warning = FALSE, gganimate = list(nframes = 20), cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "grey", se = FALSE, method = 'loess', formula = y ~ x) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = species)) +
  transition_layers(
    layer_length = 1, transition_length = 2,
    from_blank = FALSE, keep_layers = c(Inf, 0, 0)
  ) +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade()
```
]
--

.pull-right[
`transition_layers()`

New layers are being added (and removed) over the dots.
]

---

## Views

How the plot window changes through the animation.

```{r views-tbl, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
  ~ Function, ~ Description,
  "view_follow", "Change the view to follow the range of current data.",
  "view_step", "Similar to view_follow, except the view is static between transitions.",
  "view_step_manual", "Same as view_step, except view ranges are manually defined.",
  "view_zoom", "Similar to view_step, but appears smoother by zooming out then in.",
  "view_zoom_manual", "Same as view_zoom, except view ranges are manually defined."
) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 26)
```

---

## Views

.task[
Which view was used in the following animations?
]

.pull-left[
```{r view-follow, echo = FALSE, gganimate = list(nframes = 20), cache = TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "{closest_state}") +
  transition_states(species, 
                    transition_length = 4, 
                    state_length = 1) +
  view_follow()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
`view_follow()`

Plot axis follows the range of the data.
]

---

## Shadows

How the history of the animation is shown. Useful to indicate speed of changes.

```{r shadows-tbl, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
  ~ Function, ~ Description,
  "shadow_mark", "Previous (and/or future) frames leave permananent background marks.",
  "shadow_trail", "Similar to shadow_mark, except marks are from tweened data.",
  "shadow_wake", "Shows a shadow which diminishes in size and/or opacity over time."
) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 26)
```

---

## Shadows

.task[
Which shadow was used in the following animations?
]

.pull-left[
```{r shadow-wake, echo = FALSE, gganimate = list(nframes = 50), warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "{closest_state}") +
  transition_states(species, 
                    transition_length = 4, 
                    state_length = 1) +
  shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.1)
```
]
--

.pull-right[
`shadow_wake()`

The older tails of the points shrink in size, leaving a "wake" behind it.
]

---

## Shadows

.task[
Which shadow was used in the following animations?
]

.pull-left[
```{r shadow-mark, echo = FALSE, gganimate = list(nframes = 20), cache = TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(airquality, aes(Day, Temp)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
  transition_time(Month) +
  shadow_mark(color = "black", size = 0.75)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
`shadow_mark()`

Permanent marks are left by previous points in the animation.
]

---

## Entrances and exits

How elements of the plot appear and disappear.

```{r enter-exit-tbl, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
  ~ Function, ~ Description,
  "enter_appear/exit_disappear", "Poof! Instantly appears or disappears.",
  "enter_fade/exit_fade", "Opacity is used to fade in or out the elements.",
  "enter_grow/exit_shrink", "Element size will grow from or shrink to zero.",
  "enter_recolor/exit_recolor", "Change element colors to blend into the background.",
  "enter_fly/exit_fly", "Elements will move from/to a specific x,y position.",
  "enter_drift/exit_drift", "Elements will shift relative from/to their x,y position.",
  "enter_reset/exit_reset", "Clear all previously added entrace/exits."
) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 26)
```

---

## Animation controls

How data moves from one position to another. 

```r
p + ease_aes({aesthetic} = {ease})
p + ease_aes(x = "cubic")
```

## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

Pass in the dataset to ggplot

.pull-left[
```{r dino-1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="dino-1", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

For each dataset we have x and y values, in addition we can map dataset to color

.pull-left[
```{r dino-2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,
  aes(x, y, color=dataset)) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="dino-2", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

Trying a simple scatter plot first, but there is too much information

.pull-left[
```{r dino-3, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,
       aes(x, y, color = dataset)) +
  geom_point() #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="dino-3", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

We can use facets to split up by dataset, revealing the different distributions

.pull-left[
```{r dino-4, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,
       aes(x, y, color = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dataset)#<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="dino-4", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

We can just as easily turn it into an animation, transitioning between dataset states! 

.pull-left[
```{r dino-5, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,
       aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(dataset, 3, 1) + #<<
  labs(title = "Dataset: {closest_state}") #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="dino-5", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, gganimate = list(nframes = 50), cache = TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
```

# Tips

---

## Animation options

Sometimes you need more frames, sometimes fewer

- Save plot object, and use `animate()` with arguments like 
  - `nframes`: number of frames to render (default 100)
  - `fps`: framerate of the animation in frames/sec (default 10)
  - `duration`: length of the animation in seconds (unset by default)
  - etc.

--
- In R Markdown, specify the arguments to `animate()` in the chunk options when using `gganimate`, e.g. `{r, gganimate = list(nframes = 50, fps = 20)}`

--
- Learn more at https://gganimate.com/reference/animate.html

---

## Considerations in making effective animations

- Pace: speed of animation
Quick animations may be hard to follow. Slow animations are boring and tedious.

--
- Perplex: amount of information
It is easy for animations to be overwhelming and confusing. Multiple simple animations can be easier to digest.

--
- Purpose: Usefulness of using animation
Is animation needed? Does it provide additional value?
