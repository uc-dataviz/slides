> It is displayed in place of the image in browsers if the image file is not loaded or when the user has chosen not to view images.

## Alt and surrounding text

```
"CHART TYPE of TYPE OF DATA where REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`

+ Link to data source somewhere in the text
```

--
- `CHART TYPE`: It's helpful for people with partial sight to know what chart type it is and gives context for understanding the rest of the visual.

--
- `TYPE OF DATA`: What data is included in the chart? The x and y axis labels may help you figure this out.

--
- `REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`: Think about why you're including this visual. What does it show thatâ€™s meaningful. There should be a point to every visual and you should tell people what to look for.

--
- `Link to data source`: Don't include this in your alt text, but it should be included somewhere in the surrounding text.

Scatter plots are among the more difficult graphs to describe, especially if there is a need to make specific data point accessible.

- Identify the image as a scatterplot
- Provide the title and axis labels
- Focus on the overall trend

Alan Lundgard, MIT CSAIL

IEEE Transactions on Visualization & Computer Graphics (Proceedings of IEEE VIS), 2021

>To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences.

## Testing for colorblind friendliness

- Best way to test is with users (or collaborators) who have these color deficiencies

- `colorblindr::cvd_grid()`

- Simulation software also helps, e.g. Sim Daltonism for [Mac](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) and [PC](https://pcmacstore.com/en/app/693112260/sim-daltonism)

---

## Color contrast

- Background and foreground text should have sufficient contrast to be distinguishable by users with different vision

- Web app for checking color contrast checking: [Color Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)

- An WIP R package for checking for color contrast: [**coloratio**](https://matt-dray.github.io/coloratio)

.small[
```{r}
cr_get_ratio("black", "white")
cr_get_ratio("#FFFFFF", "#000000")
cr_get_ratio("black", "gray10")
```
]

---

## Double encoding

Use shape *and* color where possible

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
fig2 <- nurses_subset %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = hourly_wage_median, color = state, linetype = state)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  colorblindr::scale_color_OkabeIto() +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Median hourly wage", color = "State", linetype = "State",
    title = "Median hourly wage of Registered Nurses"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 6) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.15, 0.75),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white")
    )

cvd_grid(fig2)
```

---

## Use direct labeling

- Prefer direct labeling where color is used to display information over a legend

- Quicker to read

- Ensures graph can be understood without reliance on color

---

## Without direct labeling

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
fig3 <- nurses_subset %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual_salary_median, color = state, linetype = state)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "K")) +
  colorblindr::scale_color_OkabeIto() +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Annual median salary", color = "State", linetype = "State",
    title = "Annual median salary of Registered Nurses"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 6) +
  theme(
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
    legend.position = c(0.2, 0.75)
    )

cvd_grid(fig3)
```

---

## With direct labeling

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
fig4 <- nurses_subset %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual_salary_median, color = state, linetype = state)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE, size = 2) +
  geom_text(
    data = nurses_subset %>% filter(year == max(year)),
    aes(label = state), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 1,
    show.legend = FALSE, size = 3
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "K")) +
  colorblindr::scale_color_OkabeIto() +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Annual median salary", color = "State", linetype = "State",
    title = "Annual median salary of Registered Nurses"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 6) +
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.1, "in")
    )

cvd_grid(fig4)
```

---

## Use whitespace or pattern to separate elements

- Separate elements with whitespace or pattern

- Allows for distinguishing between data without entirely relying on contrast between colors

---

## Without whitespace

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
fig5 <- nurses_subset %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2000, 2010, 2020)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = total_employed_rn, fill = state)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  colorblindr::scale_color_OkabeIto() +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Proportion of Registered Nurses", fill = "State",
    title = "Total employed Registered Nurses"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 6)

cvd_grid(fig5)
```

---

## With whitespace

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
fig6 <- nurses_subset %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2000, 2010, 2020)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = total_employed_rn, fill = state)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill", color = "white", size = 1) +
  colorblindr::scale_color_OkabeIto() +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Proportion of Registered Nurses", 
    fill = "State",
    title = "Total employed Registered Nurses"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 6)

cvd_grid(fig6)
```

## Accessibility and fonts

- Use a font that has been tested for accessibility (e.g., [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont))

--
- Keep plot labels and annotations similarly sized as the rest of your text (e.g., `ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 16))`)
